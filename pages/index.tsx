When you are trading with a counterpart that you do not know, we recommend that you use the chat to communicate with him/her and as well the seller needs to provide his/her Email address which is attached to his/her HTX Account. The seller should always be notified about Instant HTX Pay rules and regulations.</p>

              <h1 className="text-md font-bold">Step 4: The transaction was successful or the counterparty was not responding</h1>
              <p className="mt-6">In most cases, when everything goes smoothly, the buyer pays and the seller releases the crypto, but what happens if the counterpart was not fair? In other words, the buyer did not transfer the money or the seller did not release the crypto after the buyer made the payment.</p>

              <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Why Is the Escrow Service Important?</h1>
              <p>The escrow service protects HTX&apos;s users from scammers. If a user tries to convince you to make a deal outside the HTX P2P platform, ignore the suggestion and open an appeal. If you make a deal outside the platform we cannot protect you. </p>
              <p>Imagine that you want to buy cryptocurrency and you find an offer at a competitive price but the seller seems new to the platform, with zero completed orders. How can you be sure that the seller will transfer the cryptocurrency to your wallet?</p>
              <p>The escrow service aims to solve this type of situation, by holding the cryptocurrency in a deposit. When there is no agreement and the counterpart opens an appeal, HTX&apos;s customer service will analyze both the buyer&apos;s and the seller&apos;s stories. If the buyer wins the appeal, the cryptocurrency will be released to his wallet. However, if he loses the appeal, the cryptocurrency will go to the seller&apos;s wallet. </p>
              <p>While the cryptocurrency is in the deposit, users can trade safely without the risk of losing money. Whatever amount of money you trade, all amounts are important to HTX P2P. </p>
